<h1>The Quest for the Legendary Burrito</h1>
<div>
 <p>A long time ago before people took foot on earth, food took over. There was a king KaBob. Every day King KaBob gave all the food quests but there was this family deep into the plate never to be seen. But one day a burrito broke the family food rule. He went all the way to the fruit plate past the fun dip dust desert far away from the rotton cheese to the mighty King KaBob. He got his quest! He has to go to the drink asiel from the rip of walmart, walmark. While going there, the burrito met a moldy compost named Tronald Dump, a piece of rock solid cheese named Burock Obimma, and a stale bread named Dough Triden. The burrito over heard them talking about how the forbiddon FIJI water bottle didn't vote for them. </p>
